# Coding Integration - Math / Science / Data Science

## Part 1 Coding Integration in Science - SNC1W

In this first notebook we will be exploring the following Expectations

## A. STEM Skills, Careers, and Connections
### A1. STEM Investigation Skills

A1.2 apply a scientific experimentation process and associated skills to conduct investigations, making connections between their observations and findings and the scientific concepts they are learning

A1.3 apply an engineering design process and associated skills to design, build, and test devices, models, structures, and/or systems

A1.4 apply **coding skills to investigate and to model scientific concepts and relationships**

## D. Physics - Principles and Applications of Electricity

D2.3 identify the components of a direct current (DC) circuit and explain their functions, and identify electrical quantities, their symbols, and their corresponding International System of Units (SI) units

D2.5 apply a mathematical model to calculate electric current, potential difference, and resistance in real-world situations

D2.6 construct series and parallel circuits to compare electric current, potential difference, and resistance in both types of circuits
